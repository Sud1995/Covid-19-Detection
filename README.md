# Covid-19-Detection-from-X-Ray-Images-using-CNN
COVID-19 detection using X-ray images involves using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images as either COVID-19 positive or negative. This method leverages deep learning to identify patterns in medical images that are indicative of the disease.
Data Collection:

Gather a dataset of chest X-ray images, including images of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and those without.
Sources may include public datasets, hospitals, or collaborations with medical institutions.

Data Preprocessing:

Resize images to a uniform size suitable for the CNN input.
Normalize pixel values to improve convergence during training.
Apply data augmentation techniques (rotation, flipping, zooming) to increase dataset variability and prevent overfitting.

Model Architecture:

Design or select a CNN architecture. Popular choices include pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet50, or custom architectures tailored for the task.
The architecture typically consists of several convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

Training:

Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
Train the CNN using the training set, adjusting parameters like learning rate and batch size.
Use the validation set to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.

Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Confusion matrices can help visualize true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

Deployment:

Once the model achieves satisfactory performance, deploy it for clinical use.
Integration into hospital systems for real-time diagnosis support can be considered.
